# Introduction

Glimmer is a flexible, low-level rendering pipeline for building a "live" DOM
from [Handlebars][handlebars] templates that can subsequently be updated cheaply
when data changes.

In addition to the basic Handlebars features such as helpers and partials,
Glimmer also comes with built-in support for a very flexible and powerful
primitive called "Components" and a set of low-level hooks which the host
environment can use to build other high-level, user-facing features.

This document will give you an overview of Glimmer's core architecture. While
this guide is fairly detailed, this is not intended to be an always up-to-date
API documentation or getting started guide. When code examples are given in
this document, you should generally treat them as simplified pseudo-code that
help illustrate the design rather than describing the precise implementation
details in the current codebase.

The code examples in this document are written in [TypeScript][typescript].
