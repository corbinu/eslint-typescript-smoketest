		At first I was going to put "MenuItem",
		as per https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/501,
		but then again we may re-introduce "MenuItem" in future and blow this test up.
		So here is something unique that has better chance not to appear.
		This comment also offsets error's row and column numbers so if you edit,
		please do so beyond the unicorn.
