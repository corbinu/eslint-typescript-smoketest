## Live demo a TypeScript file

Run command `Demo file` to live test some TypeScript code. It is transpiled on the fly, executed in nodejs and output is shown back to you.

Whenever you explicitly run the `save` command the file is run again. You can use this to easily try out how your code will behave without having to setup an entire toolchain or leave your IDE.

> Stop demo by closing tab or running the command `Demo stop`.
