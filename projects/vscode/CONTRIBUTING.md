## Contributing Issues

### Before Submitting an Issue
First, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Use this [query](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to search for the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

üëç - upvote

The VS Code project is distributed across multiple repositories, try to file the issue against the correct repository [Related Projects](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects).

If your issue is a question then please ask the question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) using the tag `vscode`.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.

* Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:

* Provide reproducible steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* A description of what you expect to happen
* Animated GIFs
* Code that demonstrates the issue, when providing a code snippet also include it in source and not only as an image
* Version of VS Code
* Errors in the Dev Tools Console (Help | Toggle Developer Tools)
* When you have extensions installed, can you reproduce the issue when starting vscode without extensions by using the `--disable-extensions` command line argument?

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!

Finally, this is our [issue tracking](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking) work flow that describes what happens once you submitted an issue.
